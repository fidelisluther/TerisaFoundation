                  <h2 class="about_taital">who we are</h2>
                  <p class="about_text">Terisa Foundation is a non-profit social enterprise that is dedicated to empowering women and girls living in informal settlements and ASAL areas 
                     to overcome poverty and achieve their full potential. We believe that every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances, deserves the opportunity to succeed and thrive.</p>
                  <p class="about_text">Our mission is to provide support, resources, and education to underserved communities, with a particular focus on women and girls. We recognize that women and girls 
                     face unique challenges and barriers, and we are committed to addressing these challenges head-on.</p>
                  <p class="about_text">One of our flagship initiatives is the Pad A Girl Initiative, which aims to provide access to sanitary pads for girls in underserved communities. We understand that
                      the cost of sanitary pads can be prohibitively expensive for many families, leading to girls missing school and experiencing shame and stigma. By providing access to these essential items, 
                      we are helping to ensure that girls can continue their education and achieve their goals.</p> 
                  <p class="about_text">Another key initiative is the Biashara Initiative, which provides training, mentorship, and grants to young women running micro businesses in informal settlements. 
                     We recognize the critical role that these businesses play in supporting their communities, and we are committed to helping these entrepreneurs succeed and grow.</p>
                  <p class="about_text">In addition, we are proud to be launching our new Tech Space Initiative, which aims to introduce high school students to the exciting world of technology. 
                     Through this program, students will learn basic computer skills, coding, cyber security, and other essential topics that will help them succeed in the modern world.</p> 
                  <p class="about_text">At Terisa Foundation, we are passionate about our work and committed to making a meaningful difference in the lives of the individuals and communities we serve. 
                     We believe that by providing support, resources, and education, we can empower women and girls to achieve their full potential and build a better future for themselves and their families.</p> 
                  <p class="about_text">If you are interested in supporting our work, we welcome your involvement. Whether through donations, volunteering, or spreading the word about our initiatives, your support can make a real difference 
                     in the lives of the individuals and communities we serve. Thank you for your consideration and support.</p>
